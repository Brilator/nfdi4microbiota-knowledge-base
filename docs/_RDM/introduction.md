## Research data
Research data is "any information collected, stored, and processed to produce and validate original research results" [DeWitt Wallace Library](https://libguides.macalester.edu/data1). There is no consensus on the definition, the definition varies depending on disciplines and research funders. 

Data types in microbiology include the following:
* Crystallographic data
* Gene expression data
* Geographical data
* Image data
* Linked Open Data (LOD)
* Macromolecular structures
* Microbiome data (e.g. virome data)
* Nucleotide (DNA and RNA) sequences (e.g. high-throughput sequencing data, genetic polymorphisms)
* Omics data (e.g. genomics data, metagenomics data, functional genomics data, proteomics data, transcriptomics data)
* Phenotypic data
* Protein sequences
* Quantitative microbiological data
* Semantic data
* Scientific texts
* Species interaction data (e.g. physical microbial interaction data)
