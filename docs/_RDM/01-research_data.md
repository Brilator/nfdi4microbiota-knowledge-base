## Common data types in microbiology
Data types in microbiology include the following:
* High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data also known as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data such as:
  * Genomics (DNA-Seq) and metagenomics data
  * Expression data (RNA-Seq)
  * Specific procotols such as CLIP-Seq, HiC, RIP-Seq, RIL-Seq, Ribo-Seq
* Proteomics
* Metabolomics
* Crystallographic data
* Gene expression data from microarrays
* Geospatial data
* Image data
* Linked Open Data (LOD)
* Macromolecular structures
* Phenotypic data
* Quantitative microbiological data
* Semantic data
* Scientific texts
* Species interaction data (e.g. physical microbial interaction data)
