## Sharing (raw) research data during the project phase

### Types of data that can be shared
* Primary / raw data
* Microdata
* Aggregate data
* Metadata (e.g. semantic metadata, metadata about collections)

### Collaboration tools and software

#### General-purpose collaboration tools
* [B2DROP](https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2drop)
* Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/dashboard))
* [SciFlow](https://www.sciflow.net/en/)
* [SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
* [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)
* [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/#what-is-datalad)

#### Discipline-specific collaboration tools
* [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/)

### Benefits of sharing your research data (1)
* Make your research transparent and thus ncrease trust in science.
* Be the first of claiming an idea, providing data to support it and get feedback.
* Increase the speed of discovery and the knowledge creation process.
* Internationalize your research and be inclusive.
