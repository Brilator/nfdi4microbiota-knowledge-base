:pushpin: <b>Background</b>

NFDI4Microbiota is a consortium that is part of the German NFDI (National research Data Infrastructure).<br/>
The vision of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium is that researchers in microbiology (including bacteriology,<br/> virology, protistology, mycology and parasitology) can translate research data easily into a deep understanding <br/> of microbial species and their interactions on a molecular level. <br/>

:pushpin: <b>Mission</b>

The mission of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium is to be the central hub in Germany for supporting the <br/>
microbiology community with access to data, analysis services, data/metadata standards and training.

:pushpin: <b>Aims and objectives</b>

The aims and objectives of NFDI4Microbiota are:

- Generate a broad awareness of the importance of the FAIR principles, open science and reproducible research in the microbiological community and drive a cultural change toward their widespread adaptation.
- Equip the community with the required skills and literacy for efficient and data-driven microbial research by providing a comprehensive training program.
- Increase the value of other NFDIs by adding microbial expertise and connecting the national and international microbiology communities.
- Improve the research process by mobilizing, structuring and linking available data, information and knowledge related to microorganisms.
- Support high-quality research data management by introducing professional data stewards into the microbiological research process.
- Increase the value of data by standardizing and systematically collecting rich metadata and building tools for querying.
- Make research more reproducible by standardizing data processing and analysis.
- Provide computational tools and infrastructure for the translation of data into new knowledge.
- Provide central information hubs tailored to address the needs of the microbial research community and its sub-fields.
- Continuously adapt the solutions provided to meet the future needs of our microbiology community.
