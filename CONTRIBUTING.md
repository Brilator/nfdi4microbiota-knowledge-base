## Creating a GitHub account

Users will need a GitHub account if they wish to contribute to the Knowledge Base. If you do not already have an account, go to the GitHub [homepage](https://github.com/) and click the `Sign Up` button to create one. Then follow the instructions. Once you have created an account, and signed in, go to the [Knowledge Base repository](https://github.com/NFDI4Microbiota/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base.github.io)

## Making changes to the repository

### Editing existing files

In order to make changes to the respository, users must edit Markdown files on the GitHub editor. If you have never used Markdown files before, [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is a link to a markdown tutorial. If you just need to look up syntax, follow this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

*Note: Markdown files are files which end with the `.md` prefix for example, this `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Please do not try to edit non Markdown files*

To edit an existing file:

1. Navigate to file on the repository and click on it
2. Click on the pen icon on the top right to begin editing
3. After editing the file, add a commit name that includes the name of the edited file and the issue number (if available)
4. Select the `Create new branch` option and add a branch name which includes the name of the edited file and the issue number (if available)
5. Press the `Propose changes` button
6. Write a comment briefly describing the changes you have made
7. TODO: assign to anyone specific?
8. Press the `Create pull request` button
9. A member of the NFDI4Microbiota team will then review and add your changes to the Knowledge Base

*Note: All files should be edited according to the [style guide](#markdown-style-guide).*

### Creating new content
