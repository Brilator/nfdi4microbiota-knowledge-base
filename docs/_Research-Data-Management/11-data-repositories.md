# Selection and preparation of data to be published

# Selection of a trusted repository

## Criteria
A potential repository should optimally widely used (in similar publications in the field) while offering a scope that is as specific as possible (supporting most specific metadata schemas).
Researchers should check whether the repository supports **open access** for non-sensitive data and provides persistent identifiers for submitted datasets.

## In order of preference

## Repository finders
Databases and data repositories in microbiology can be found in the two following registries:
* [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) ([search results](https://www.re3data.org/search?query=Microbiology) for "Microbiology")
* [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/) ([search results](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Database&subjects=microbiology&page=1) for Databases in Microbiology)

## Well-established repositories in microbiology
Primary raw data from experiments studying the microbiota consists in most cases of either sequence data, mass spectra or images and derived results.

### ENA and SRA for nucleotide data
EMBL-EBI provides the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) which hosts world-wide data from raw sequencing runs to sequence assembly information and functional annotation.
This also includes all data hosted at the American NIH's NCBI [Sequencing Read Library (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), were submissions are structured by BioProject -> SRA Study -> BioSample -> Run.

### PRIDE for proteomics data
EMBL-EBI provides the [PRoteomics IDEntifications Database (PRIDE)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) for submission of protein and peptide data from raw mass spectra and subsequent analysis steps.

### BioImage Archive for imaging data
EMBL-EBI provides the [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive) for submission of most imaging techniques (especially microscopy) from molecules to organisms.

### EMPIAR for electron microscopy data
EMBL-EBI provides the [Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar) for most electron microscopy (EM) derived data.
