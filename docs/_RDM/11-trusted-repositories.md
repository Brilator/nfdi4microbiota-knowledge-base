# General overview of available repositories
[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) offers a registry of research data repositories with a keyword search and overview of all subjects and disciplines.

A potential repository should optimally widely used (in similar publications in the field) while offering a scope that is as specific as possible (supporting most specific meta data schemas).
Researchers should check whether the repository supports **open access** for non-sensitive data and provides persistent identifiers for submitted datasets.

# Recommended repositories for microbiology data
Primary raw data from experiments studying the microbiota consists in most cases of either sequence data, mass spectra or images and derived results.

## ENA and SRA for nucleotide data
EMBL-EBI provides the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) which hosts world-wide data from raw sequencing runs to sequence assembly information and functional annotation.
This also includes all data hosted at the American NIH's NCBI [Sequencing Read Library (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), were submissions are structured by BioProject -> SRA Study -> BioSample -> Run.

## PRIDE for proteomics data
EMBL-EBI provides the [PRoteomics IDEntifications Database (PRIDE)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) for submission of protein and peptide data from raw mass spectra and subsequent analysis steps.

## BioImage Archive for imaging data
EMBL-EBI provides the [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive) for submission of most imaging techniques (especially microscopy) from molecules to organisms.

## EMPIAR for electron microscopy data
EMBL-EBI provides the [Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar) for most electron microscopy (EM) derived data.
