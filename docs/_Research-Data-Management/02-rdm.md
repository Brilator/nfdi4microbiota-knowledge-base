# Definition of Research Data Management (RDM)
Research Data Management (RDM) is the process that includes all methods and procedures that aim to make research data usable over the long-term. RDM usually includes the following steps:
* Planning
* Data Collection
* Data Processing & Analysis
* Data Sharing & Publishing
* Digital Preservation
* Data Discovery & Reuse

# Research data life cycle
The RDM steps can be represented as a cycle called the research data life cycle:

# Benefits of RDM
* **Researchers' own interests**
    * Good Scientific Practice (GSP)
    * Knowledge management / transfer
    * Preventing data loss
    * Saving yourself time in the future 
* **External interests**
    * Research funders
    * Publishers
    * Researchers' own institution

# Consequences of poor RDM
Consequences of poor RDM include paper retraction (e.g. [González Amorós & de Puit](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2015.04.005)).
