## Definitions

* **Archive:** organization, place or collection that stores information for long-tern preservation such that it can be accessed and reused by a designated community.
* **Backup:** practice of keeping additional copies of your research data in a separate physical or cloud locations from your files in storage.
* **Data interoperability:** ability of a dataset to work with other datasets or systems without special effort on the part of the user.
* **Data Management Plan (DMP):** formal and living document to describe the data, their generation and processing during the project, as well as how the data and research results will be archived afterwards to remain available, usable and comprehensible.
* **Data repository:** location where digital (and physical) objects are stored and documented, and which enable the separate publication and archiving of these objects. Data access can be either open or restricted to a group of users.
* **Digital preservation:** act of ensuring continued findability and access to digital material and maintaining it independently understandable and reusable by a designated community, and with evidence supporting its authenticity, for as long as necessary.
* **Dublin Core:** domain-agnostic, basic, widely used metadata standard.
* **FAIR data principles:** domain-agnostic, basic, widely used metadata standard.
* **Good Scientific Practice (GSP):** principles, values and standards of behavior and practice that must be achieved and maintained in the delivery of work activities, the provision of care and personal conduct.
* **Metadata:** data about data.
* **Open Science:** make publicly funded research results (e.g. publications, research data, processes) publicly and freely accessible in digital formats under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.
* **Open source software:** software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
* **Persistent Identifier (PID):** globally unique, actionable and machine-resolvable strings that act as a long-lasting reference to a digital object (e.g. a dataset).
* **Preregistration:** practice of documenting your research plan (i.e. research question and study design) before conducting a scientific investigation, and depositing that plan in a read-only public repository.
* **Storage:** act of keeping your research data in a secure location that you can access readily.
