# Contributing to the NFDI4Micobiota Knowledge Base

This document includes instructions on how to contribute to the Knowledge base and is intended for contributors with no prior GitHub experience. Feel free to skip to the appropriate section if you feel like you are an experienced user.

The main steps a user must follow to contribute to the Knowledge Base are:

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Making changes to files in the repository
    1. Editing existing file
    2. Creating new content

## Creating a GitHub account

Users will need a GitHub account if they wish to contribute to the Knowledge Base. To create an acocunt, go to the GitHub [homepage](https://github.com/) and click the `Sign Up` button. Then follow the instructions. Once you have created an account, and signed in, go to the [Knowledge Base repository](https://github.com/NFDI4Microbiota/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base.github.io)

## Making changes to the repository

### Editing existing files

In order to make changes to the respository, users must edit Markdown files on the GitHub editor. If you have never used Markdown files before, [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) is a link to a markdown tutorial. If you just need to look up syntax, follow this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

After editing the file, add a commit name that includes the name of a file and the issue number (if available).
Next, select the `Create new branch` button and then press the `Commit changes` button.

*Note: All files should be edited according to the style guide (see below).*

### Creating new content

If you want to create a page on the website that doesn't already exist, create a new issue. This can be done by going to the [issues page](https://github.com/NFDI4Microbiota/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base.github.io/issues) and clicking the `New Issue` button. Add the name of the suggested page for the title and add a description of what you want to include in the new page. Then click the `Submit new issue` button.
