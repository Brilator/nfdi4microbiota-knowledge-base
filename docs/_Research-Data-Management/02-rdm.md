## Definition of Research Data Management (RDM)
Research Data Management (RDM) is a series of measures that need to be taken during a research project in order to (1) obtain high-quality data (whether produced or reused), (2) make data avaialbe and usable over the long-term and (3) make research findings reproducible beyond the research project {% cite RfII_RD bres_2022 voigt_2022 %}.

## Research data life cycle
The RDM steps can be represented as a cycle called the research data life cycle:

## Benefits of RDM
* **Researchers' own interests**
    * Good Scientific Practice (GSP)
    * Knowledge management / transfer
    * Preventing data loss
    * Saving yourself time in the future 
* **External interests**
    * Research funders
    * Publishers
    * Researchers' own institution

## Consequences of poor RDM
Consequences of poor RDM include paper retraction (e.g. [González Amorós & de Puit](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2015.04.005)).
