# Introduction
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are required [in DFG funding proposals since 2022](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/announcements_proposals/2022/info_wissenschaft_22_25/index.html), and are also sometimes required by researchers' own institution. DMPs act as a reporting tool for funders to hold grant recipients accountable to conduct good and open science with periodic updates or upon changes. For researchers, DMPs are meant as a living document accompanying them from proposal writing or project start to data generation, analysis, publication and archiving.

# Content of DMPs
DMPs usually contain information that covers the whole research data life cycle, as well as general information such as:
* Responsibilities and obligations
* Description of the research project
* Costs and resources
* Description of the research data: type, quality, organization and usage
* Metadata and referenceability
* Publication (access and reuse)
* Data citation
* Storage and security
* Digital preservation
* Legal aspects and anonymisation
* Deletion

# Benefits
When implemented correctly, a DMP can [benefit all stakeholders](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006750) of a research project despite the initial overhead of creating the DMP itself:

- **Transparency and reproducibility:** Besides as a reporting tool to funders and governing institutions, a DMP can be handed to new collaborators of a project to convey a short description, experimental design, methodological spectrum, proposed hypotheses and general progress.
This way, all stakeholders can quickly look up the state of data, find the responsible person for questions and document their own contribution.
- **Resource management:** An included timeline projects when personal and lab resources need to be available and enable service facilities (e.g. sequencing or IT) to schedule their resources/capacity and project costs more accurately.
- **Standardize processes:** DMPs can easily be adapted to similar projects and shared for this purpose between researchers in the same field/institute to reduce the effort for new proposals and resort to fixed entities (e.g. ethical board).

# DMP tools
Even though, it is generally possible to formulate a DMP in an office document, the use of more dynamic and machine-readable formats finally enables the full anticipated potential.
In Germany the [Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO)](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/) has gained widespread adoption among institutes and consortia.
This web-tool is used to create institute-wide templates and organize DMPs in different versions and share them with all stakeholders.
RDMO organizes individual plans around predefined templates that reflect the requirements of the respective institution, discipline or funder.
This ensures machine-actionable compatibility for administrative stakeholders and re-usability for researchers in following projects.
These templates usually contain much more aspects that do not have to be answered right from the start of a project, but can be completed as the research progresses.
